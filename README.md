# UtilityAi-TurnBasedCombatSystem

Unity project of my master's thesis about a Utility AI for turn-based combat systems. The AI is capable of deciding which action is the best depending on the NPC's current situation.

**Actions**
- Attack, Heal, Buff or Debuff (Area of Effect, Single Target)
- Defend (Self, Teammates)
- Interrupt enemies from executing an action
- Hide from enemies
- Move to different spots 
- Avoid Area of Effect 

**Considerations**
- Ability Score
- Vitals of an enemy/ally or the whole team
- Distance to an enemy/ally
- Line of Sight
- Preparation time of an ability
- i.a.
